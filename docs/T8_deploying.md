Yes, you can save and load a full PyTorch model without having to manually rebuild its architecture before loading, but there are important caveats and alternative approaches:

---

## 1. Saving and Loading the Entire Model (Pickle-Based)

- **How it works:**  
  Use `torch.save(model, PATH)` to save the entire model, including its architecture and parameters. To load, simply use `model = torch.load(PATH)`. This method serializes the model object using Python's pickle module, which includes both the architecture and weights[1][2][3][5].

- **Pros:**  
  - No need to redefine or rebuild the model architecture before loading.
  - Easiest syntax for quick prototyping and when you control both save and load environments.

- **Cons:**  
  - The saved model is tightly coupled to the exact Python class definition and directory structure at the time of saving. If you move files, refactor code, or change environments, loading can break[1][3][5].
  - Less portable and more brittle for long-term or cross-project use.

---

## 2. TorchScript Export (Recommended for Portability)

- **How it works:**  
  Convert your model to TorchScript using `torch.jit.script(model)` or `torch.jit.trace(model, example_input)`, then save with `model_scripted.save(PATH)`. Load with `model = torch.jit.load(PATH)`. This approach saves both the model structure and weights in a portable format that does not require the original Python class definition[1][2].

- **Pros:**  
  - No need to redefine the architecture before loading.
  - More robust and portable across different environments.
  - Suitable for deployment and inference in C++ or other non-Python environments.

- **Cons:**  
  - Some dynamic Python code may not be compatible with TorchScript.

## 3. Saving Only State Dict (Most Flexible, Requires Architecture)

- **How it works:**  
  Save only the model's parameters using `torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)`. To load, you must instantiate the model architecture and then call `model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))`[1][2][5].

- **Pros:**  
  - Most flexible and robust for long-term use.
  - Not tied to directory structure or Python class location.

- **Cons:**  
  - You must have access to the model's class definition and instantiate it before loading weights.

## Summary Table

| Method                         | Need to Define Architecture Before Loading? | Portability        | Use Case                               |
|---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------:|:------------------:|----------------------------------------|
| `torch.save(model)` / `torch.load()` | No                                       | Low (brittle)      | Quick prototyping, same environment    |
| TorchScript (`torch.jit`)       | No                                        | High               | Deployment, cross-platform inference   |
| State Dict (`state_dict`)       | Yes                                       | High               | Production, research, code evolution   |

**In conclusion:**  
You can load a full PyTorch model without rebuilding its architecture if you use either the full model save/load approach (`torch.save(model, ...)` and `torch.load(...)`) or export to TorchScript. However, the full model approach is less robust to changes in your codebase, while TorchScript is preferred for portability and deployment[1][2][3][5].
